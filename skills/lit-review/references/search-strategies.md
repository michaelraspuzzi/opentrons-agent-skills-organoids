# Search Strategies for Cardiac Organoid Literature

## Search Sequence (Follow This Order)

### Phase 1: Establish Context (1-2 searches)
```
cardiac organoid review 2024
heart organoid review recent
```
Goal: Get oriented, find recent reviews that cite key papers

### Phase 2: Lab-Specific Searches (2-3 searches per relevant lab)
```
[PI name] cardiac organoid 2024 OR 2025
[PI name] heart organoid site:pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
```
Goal: Find recent work from key groups identified in field-landscape.md

### Phase 3: Topic Deep-Dive (3-5 searches)
```
"cardiac organoid" [specific topic] 2024
heart organoid [specific topic] site:pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
[specific topic] iPSC cardiomyocyte 3D
```
Goal: Comprehensive coverage of the specific question

### Phase 4: Gap/Limitation Search (1-2 searches)
```
cardiac organoid limitation challenge
heart organoid [topic] "future directions"
```
Goal: Identify what's missing or problematic

### Phase 5: Preprint Check (1 search)
```
cardiac organoid [topic] site:biorxiv.org
```
Goal: Catch cutting-edge unpublished work

## Query Patterns by Goal

### Finding Recent Papers from a Lab
```
[PI last name] cardiac organoid 2024 OR 2025
[PI last name] heart organoid Nature OR Cell OR Science
[Institution] cardiac organoid
```

### Finding Methods/Protocols
```
cardiac organoid protocol methods
heart organoid differentiation protocol 2024
[lab name] cardiac organoid site:protocols.io
cardiac organoid site:jove.com
```

### Finding Disease Models
```
cardiac organoid [disease name] model
heart organoid [disease] iPSC patient
[disease] cardiomyopathy organoid
```

### Finding Drug Screening Work
```
cardiac organoid drug screening
heart organoid cardiotoxicity
cardiac organoid CiPA
[drug name] cardiac organoid
```

### Finding Comparison/Review Papers
```
cardiac organoid review comparison
heart organoid methods comparison
cardiac tissue engineering review 2024
```

## Full-Text Access Strategy

### Step 1: Direct Fetch
Try fetching the URL directly from search results

### Step 2: PMC Fallback
If paywalled, search for PMC version:
```
[paper title] site:ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc
[DOI] PMC
[first author] [year] [journal] PMC
```

### Step 3: Preprint Fallback
If no PMC, search for preprint:
```
[paper title] site:biorxiv.org
[paper title] site:medrxiv.org
[first author] [key terms] preprint
```

### Step 4: Institutional Summary
If no preprint, look for summaries:
```
[paper title] site:sciencedaily.com
[paper title] site:eurekalert.org
[lab name] [topic] press release
```

### Step 5: Abstract + Citing Papers
If all else fails:
- Use PubMed abstract (usually accessible)
- Search for papers that cite this one (may have accessible summaries)
- Note as "limited access" in review

## Recency Weighting Guidelines

### High Priority (2024-2025)
- Search with year filters: `2024 OR 2025`
- These papers have latest methods and findings
- Check bioRxiv for very recent work

### Medium Priority (2022-2023)
- Important for established methods
- Multi-chamber cardioids (2023)
- Maturation advances

### Context Only (2017-2021)
- Foundational protocols (Mills 2017, Hofbauer 2021, Lewis-Israeli 2021)
- Cite for historical context but don't prioritize in searches
- These are in foundational-papers.md already

## Search Result Evaluation

### Signs of High-Quality Source
- Published in journals from field-landscape.md
- Authors include known PIs from Tier 1/2 labs
- Has DOI and is indexed in PubMed
- Cited by other papers in the field
- Includes primary data (not just review)

### Signs to Be Cautious
- Predatory journal indicators
- No institutional affiliation
- Extraordinary claims without data
- Conflicts with multiple established findings
- Very low citation count for older papers

## Common Search Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Too broad**: "heart organoid" alone returns too much noise
2. **Too narrow**: Overly specific queries miss relevant papers
3. **Wrong terms**: "cardiac spheroid" ≠ "cardiac organoid" (different methods)
4. **Missing synonyms**: Search both "cardiac" and "heart"
5. **Ignoring preprints**: Field moves fast, bioRxiv essential
6. **Single database**: Use PubMed + Google Scholar + bioRxiv
7. **Skipping lab names**: PI name searches are highly efficient
